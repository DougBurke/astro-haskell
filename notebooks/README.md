# Astronomy and Haskell

These are finished and in-development [IHaskell
notebooks](http://gibiansky.github.io/IHaskell/) showing examples of
using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) for Astronomy. I am
currently only storing the input values - i.e. I have cleared the
notebook cells of their output - to make it easier for me to see how
things have changed.

Please see the [top-level
README](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/README.md)
for more information, including links to the HTML versions.
