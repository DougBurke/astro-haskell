# Astronomy and Haskell

These are finished [IHaskell
notebooks](http://gibiansky.github.io/IHaskell/) showing examples of
using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) for Astronomy. The notebooks
in this directory contain both input and output cells, so you should
be able to use a service like [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)
to view them.

Please see the [top-level
README](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/README.md)
for more information, including links to the HTML and "raw/clean"
versions.

The first two notebooks - "angular diameter distance" and "this time
with units" - were stored in this directory after the HTML version was
created, which means that the dates in the "Last time the notebook was
run" section do not match.
