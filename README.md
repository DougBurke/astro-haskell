A collection (well, at present three) of
[IHaskell notebooks](http://gibiansky.github.io/IHaskell/)
showing examples of using 
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
for Astronomy.
 
The notebooks are placed in the public domain, and come with
no warranty.

  4. [a FITSfull of ARF](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/master/html/a%20FITSfull%20of%20ARF.html)

     Notebooks: [read using nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/finished/a%20FITSfull%20of%20ARF.ipynb); [on GitHub](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/notebooks/a%20FITSfull%20of%20ARF.ipynb)

     Published: 5 April 2015

     Synopsis: What does it take to parse data from a common Astronomy file format (`FITS`), and what
     does an ARF look like? There's no fun with dimensional quantities here (that's left for an
     unspecified notebook in the future), but there's plenty of mathematical abstraction, and
     even some envy at optical Astronomers and their large mirrors.

  3. [K corrections with a dimensional twist](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/master/html/k%20corrections%20with%20a%20dimensional%20twist.html)

     Notebooks: [read using nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/finished/k%20corrections%20with%20a%20dimensional%20twist.ipynb); [on GitHub](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/notebooks/k%20corrections%20with%20a%20dimensional%20twist.ipynb)

     Published: 3 March 2015

     Synopsis: Have you ever wanted to calculate a [K
     correction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_correction)?  If so,
     then this one's for you. In the course of this notebook I also play
     around with representing spectral models and do a bit more work
     with the `dimensional-tf` package.

  2. [This time with units](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/master/html/this%20time%20with%20units.html)

     Notebooks: [read using nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/finished/this%20time%20with%20units.ipynb); [on GitHub](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/notebooks/this%20time%20with%20units.ipynb)

     Published: 20 February 2015

     Synopsis: I've moved my IHaskell to ghc version 7.8.4 so can
     repeat the previous notebook using `units` instead of
     `dimensional-tf`.

  1. [Angular Diameter Distance](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/master/html/angular%20diameter%20distance.html)

     Notebooks: [read using nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/finished/angular%20diameter%20distance.ipynb); [on GitHub](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/notebooks/angular%20diameter%20distance.ipynb)

     Published: 15 February 2015

     Synopsis: I wanted to try out the new
     [units](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/units) library, but
     it doesn't compile with ghc version 7.6.3, so I decided to try
     [dimensional-tf](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dimensional-tf)
     instead. There's some simple Astronomical calculations, plots,
     and use of units.
