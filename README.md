A collection (well, at present two)
[IHaskell notebooks](http://gibiansky.github.io/IHaskell/)
showing examples of using 
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
for Astronomy.
 
The notebooks are placed in the public domain, and come with
no warranty.

  1. [Angular Diameter Distance](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/master/html/angular%20diameter%20distance.html)

     [Notebook](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/notebooks/angular%20diameter%20distance.ipynb)

     Published: 15 February 2015

     Synopsis: I wanted to try out the new
     [units](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/units) library, but it doesn't compile
     with ghc version 7.6.3, so I decided to try
     [dimensional-tf](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dimensional-tf) instead. There's
     some simple Astronomical calculations, plots, and use of units.

  2. [This time with units](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/master/html/this%20time%20with%20units.html)

     [Notebook](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/notebooks/this%20time%20with%20units.ipynb)

     Published: 20 February 2015

     Synopsis: I've moved my IHaskell to ghc version 7.8.4 so can repeat the previous
     notebook using `units` instead of `dimensional-tf`.
