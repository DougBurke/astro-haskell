# Astronomy and Haskell

These are the HTML version of my 
[IHaskell notebooks](http://gibiansky.github.io/IHaskell/)
showing examples of using 
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
for Astronomy. 

Please see the
[top-level README](https://github.com/DougBurke/astro-haskell/blob/master/README.md)
for more information, including links
to viewers for these pages.
